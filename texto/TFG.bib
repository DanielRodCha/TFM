abstract="{\enspace}A theoretical result [10] that relates tautological consequence in many-valued logics to the ideal membership problem in algebra is revisited. The intended use of the approach in this article and its implementation is the verification of consistency and the automated extraction of knowledge in rule-based knowledge systems. Programs are written in the CoCoA language. Four RBS are studied to illustrate the implementation.",

The theory of reduction relations forms a common basis for the theory of Gr{\"o}bner bases, word problems in finitely presented groups, term rewriting systems, and lambda calculus.",
