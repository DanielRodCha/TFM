The intended use of the approach in this article and its implementation is the verification of consistency and the automated extraction of knowledge in rule-based knowledge systems. Programs are written in the CoCoA language. Four RBS are studied to illustrate the implementation.",

abstract="We present a specialised (polynomial-based) rule for the propositional logic called the Independence Rule, which is useful to compute the conservative retractions of propositional logic theories. In this paper we show the soundness and completeness of the logical calculus based on this rule, as well as other applications. The rule is defined by means of a new kind of operator on propositional formulae. It is based on the boolean derivatives on the polynomial ring                                                                           {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb F{\}}{\_}2[{\{}{\backslash}bf x{\}}]{\$}                .",
